Add ansibleadm user and change hosts file  before deploying new servers.
Add file /etc/sudoers.d/ansibleadm with content: "ansibleadm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
Add id_rsa_ansible.pub (or whatever is used for ansibleadm) to bastion and servers behind it
  for bastion use automated method:
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host
  for the rest just copy the key to bastion:
  scp -i .ssh/id_rsa_ansible .ssh/id_rsa_ansible ansibleadm@49.13.126.87:/home/ansibleadm/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible 
  scp -i .ssh/id_rsa_ansible .ssh/id_rsa_ansible.pub ansibleadm@49.13.126.87:/home/ansibleadm/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible.pub
  Then do automatic istallation of a public key using same method as with bastion. 
  Failing this, do on servers the following: 
       - mkdir ~/.ssh/
       - cat id_rsa_ansible.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys
       - chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh
       - chown ansibleadm.ansibleadm .ssh/authorized_keys
Check connection from ansible node with:
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible -W %h:%p ansibleadm@bastion-host" ansibleadm@target-server.internal


After servers deployment, add user for yourself on every server with key-based autentification

Add following users and passwords:
Master - MySQL:
  mediastream
  root
  repluser

Slave  - MySQL
  root
